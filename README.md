### ðŸŽ§ Hello ðŸŽ®

I am a developer from Montreal, Quebec. Currently working in mobile development with Dart/Flutter.

Experienced with Javascript/Typescript, C#, Dart/Flutter, React, Firebase, HTML/CSS.

I also develop indie games in Unity, as a hobby. You can find some game I've made through my itch.io link below.

When I'm not programming I am either doing music and audio production or enjoying reading, gaming or martial arts.
