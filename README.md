### ðŸŽ§ Hello ðŸŽ®

I am a web developer from Montreal, Canada.

Most experienced with React, Firebase, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Express & jQuery. Trying to learn Angular and Typescript.
Currently working on my portfolio website, and mobile versions of my projects, as well as seeking employment. 

Aside from web dev, I have a passion for game dev and am personally studying Unity and C#.

When I'm not programming I am either doing music and audio production or enjoying reading, working out or playing video games.
