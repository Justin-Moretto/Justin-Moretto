### Currently Looking for Work

I'm a full-stack web developer from Montreal, Canada.

Experienced with Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Ruby/Rails.
Recent bootcamp graduate. Currently looking for work.

Aside from web dev, I have a passion for game dev and am personally studying Unity and C#.

When I'm not programming I am either doing music and audio production or enjoying reading, working out or playing video games.
